# Probit Analysis

```{R}
# probit.R
Table1 = read.table('probit.txt', head=T)
print(Table1)
dead = Table1[,3]
prob = dead/100
print(prob)
probit = qnorm(prob)

plot(Table1$dose, probit)
```

qnorm is the inverse of the cumulative distributive function. We expected a linear-ish graph and that is exactly what we get!

# Prussian Horse Kick Analysis

```{r}
#Input
prusHorse = read.csv("prussian_kick.csv", head=T)

#table, freqTable and freqDensTable
death = prusHorse[,3]
freqTable = as.vector(as.matrix(table(death)))
freqTable = append(freqTable, numeric(5))
print(freqTable)
freqDensTable = freqTable/sum(freqTable)
barplot(freqDensTable, col='steelblue')

#fit
library(MASS)
fitdistr(death, "poisson")

#plotting the curve
curve(exp(-0.7)*(0.7)^x/factorial(x), from=-1, to=10, add=T, col='red')


# printing the table -><-
v = c(freqDensTable[1], dpois(0, 0.70), abs(freqDensTable[1] - dpois(0,0.70)))
for (i in 1:4){
    v <- append(v, c(freqDensTable[i+1], dpois(i, 0.70), abs(freqDensTable[i] - dpois(i,0.70))))
}
data = matrix(v,ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(data) = c('Measured', 'Estimated', 'Absolute Error')
table = as.table(data)
print('')
print(table)


```

I fought with this assignment for quite sometime trying to plot the poisson distribution with dpois - figured that dpois doesnt accept non integer values. had to plot it with the curve function!

The lambda was `0.70`.

I first got the raw-death-data and then calculated the frequency and frequency density tables. I then plotted the barplot of frequency density of the data. I found the lambda of the poisson distribution that fits the data. I then plotted the curve with the `curve` function.

This was fun!
