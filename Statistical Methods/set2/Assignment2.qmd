# Probit Analysis

```{R}
# probit.R
Table1 = read.table('probit.txt', head=T)
dead = Table1[,3]
prob = dead/100
print(prob)
probit = qnorm(prob)

plot(probit)
```

qnorm is the inverse of the cumulative distributive function. We expected a linear-ish graph and that is exactly what we get!

# Prussian Horse Kick Analysis

```{r}
#Input
prusHorse = read.csv("prussian_kick.csv", head=T)

#table, freqTable and freqDensTable
death = prusHorse[,3]
freqTable = as.vector(as.matrix(table(death)))
freqTable = append(freqTable, numeric(5))
print(freqTable)
freqDensTable = freqTable/sum(freqTable)
barplot(freqDensTable, col='steelblue')

#fit
library(MASS)
fitdistr(death, "poisson")
# lambda = 0.70

curve(exp(-0.7)*(0.7)^x/factorial(x), from=-1, to=10, add=T, col='red')


```

I fought with this assignment for quite sometime trying to plot
the poisson distribution with dpois - figured that dpois doesnt accept non
integer values. had to plot it with the curve function!

I first got the raw-death-data and then calculated the frequency and frequency density tables. I then plotted the barplot of frequency density of the data. I found the lambda of the poisson distribution that fits the data. I then plotted the curve with the `curve` function.

This was fun!
